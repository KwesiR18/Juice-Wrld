                I still see your shadows in my room
                Can't take back the love that I gave you
                It's to the point where I love and I hate you
                And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
                Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
                Listenin' to my heart instead of my head

                        2017 ---- His first track produced by his main producer Nick Mira, "Too Much Cash", was released in 2017. While releasing projects and songs on SoundCloud, Higgins worked in a factory, but was fired within two weeks after finding himself dissatisfied with the job. After joining the internet collective Internet Money, Higgins released his debut full-length EP, 9 9 9, on June 15, 2017, with the song "Lucid Dreams" breaking out and growing his following.

                        2018 ---- On May 4, 2018, "Lucid Dreams" was officially released as a single and given a video. It then went on to peak at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and quickly became one of the biggest streaming songs of 2018; it remains his most-streamed song, reaching over one billion streams on Spotify by January 2020. "Lucid Dreams" was followed by "Lean Wit Me" on May 22, peaking at number 68 on the Hot 100; Higgins' debut full-length Goodbye & Good Riddance, which had all three of the previous singles on it, was released the following day. On June 19, 2018, he released a two-song EP, Too Soon.., in remembrance of and dedicated to deceased rappers Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, the latter of whom was killed in a homicide case relating to robbery a day earlier. The song "Legends" from the EP charted under its debut at number 65.

                    <li>
                        2020 ---- In his song, "Legends" – which was dedicated to XXXTentacion, who was murdered in mid 2018 at age 20, and Lil Peep, who overdosed in late 2017 at age 21 – Higgins raps "What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21." Fans and media outlets commented that he had essentially predicted his own death, as he had died only days after his 21st birthday. He also died exactly 39 years after John Lennon, who Jarad would often mention in songs.
